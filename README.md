# Python Script Development using Test Driven Development.

The idea of this repo is to show using a simple example how it is possible to write a Python script using test driven development (TDD).

* As an example a script will be developed that 
  works out the complement of a given input DNA 
  sequence.
* the script will be called 'complement.py' and will
  get the sequence from a single command line argument
  and printout thats sequence's complement

  For instance:
  ```
  $ ./complement.py CAATTTGGGG
  GTTAAACCCC
  ```
* by default the script should work out the normal 
  forward 3' to 5' complement (as show above).  
* The script should have an option `--reverse` or `-r` 
  that works out the reverse complement.


  For instance:
  ```
  $ ./complement.py --reverse CAATTTGGGG
  CCCCAAATTG
  ```

* The development process will be recorded in commit 
  messages as well as in a GitHub issue #1 page 
  available at the GitHub web site (from the Issues tab) or
  directly from:

  https://github.com/ARU-Bioinf-IBDS/TDD_script_demonstration/issues/1


  GitHub issue pages are useful ways to record extra 
  information with links to commit messages. They can
  be used for project planning - we will be doing this
  next semester.

  Please note that the information in GitHub issue pages  is not stored with the repo (so it is not present on
  the local copy). For this reason please do not use for  the IB&DS coursework.
